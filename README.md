# Fraud_detection


*Alex Jurado*


## Content

Three Notebooks:

- First Notebook, named 'Generating data Profile' that generates a report of the data that can be opened in the browser. Needs to be run in a local Jupyter Notebook. Colab won't do 
- Second Notebook, 'Workbook with NN' Implementing a Neural Network using Tensor Flow and keras. Due to the unbalanced nature of the data we performed SMOTE (Explained in the notebook, but a form of data augmentation).
- Third Notebook, 'Workbook Fraud', preliminary data exploration and different approach to the data exploration to see what variables best influence fraud and will predict it in the future. Same approach as with the NN but using Random Forests and XGBoost.

One HTML file: The extracted Data profile generated in the first Notebook used for data exploration.
